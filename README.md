The movie poster includes: movie rating, poster image, title, genres, and year and displayed in sections: Current month premieres, Top anticipated movies, Top-rated movies, Digital releases of the current month, and Favorites.
You can save movies to favorites, by clicking a heart button, it turns red, and the movie is saved to local storage.
Or you can click to the red heart and it turns white, meaning the movie is removed from local storage.
